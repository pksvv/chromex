a. Handling Large Images

Timeouts: For very long pages or high numbers of splits, processing might take longer, potentially causing timeouts in serverless environments.

Limits: Consider setting limits on the maximum number of splits or page height.

b. Security Considerations

Input Sanitization: Ensure that user inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

CORS: Since API routes are part of the same Next.js application, CORS issues are minimized.
